## Best Practices

### For Blind Users
- **Be specific**: "Search for Bluetooth speakers" works better than "I need audio stuff"
- **Ask follow-ups**: "Tell me more", "What about battery life?", "How much?"
- **Multi-step is fine**: "Add this to cart and take me to checkout"
- **Natural language**: Speak like you're talking to a person

### For Power Users
- Chain commands: "Search X, filter by Y, sort by Z, show me the top result"
- Be conversational: The AI understands context from previous messages
- Ask for explanations: "Why do you recommend this?", "What's the difference?"

## Troubleshooting

### "AI not responding"

### "Actions not working"

- Verify you're on the right page (e.g., need product page to add to cart)
- Check browser console for error messages
